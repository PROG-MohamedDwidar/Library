#Attention:  
 -contribution on github doesn't reflect how developers distributed tasks among themselves  
 -the azure server will be closed due to cost related issues we will not provide a replacement and the code will net be runnable  
 -the server package inside the src file is an independent program and it has to be run first  
  
#We made it :D!
